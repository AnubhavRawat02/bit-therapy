# Desktop Pets

This is the source code of my macOS app [Desktop Pets](https://apps.apple.com/app/desktop-pets/id1575542220)!.

As you can guess, it brings Desktop Pets to macOS 🚀

## What's a Desktop Pet?

It's just a cute little animal that lives in your computer.

The most popular one was probably the [eSheep](https://github.com/Adrianotiger/desktopPet) for Windows 95.

Hope you like them too!

## Running the Project

1. Download and setup Xcode
1. Open the `PetTherapy` workspace
1. Give Xcode some time to figure out Swift Packages dependencies ([LaunchAtLogin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin) and [Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk))
1. Select target 'Desktop Pets Dev'

(For daily use I recommend getting the App from the App Store)

## Troubleshooting

### Swift Packages not loading
* Xcode does not like local swift packages 🤷‍♂️
* Try Reset Packages Cache (Package Dependencies > Right Click)
* Close Xcode and relaunch
